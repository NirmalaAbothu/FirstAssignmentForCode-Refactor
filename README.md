We can make website more accessible by as many people as possible by using appropriate semantic HTML elements. The given HTML file has div elements, for the screen readers and SEO it is difficult to identify the content with div tags. Added meaningful sematic HTML tags for page based on the page content to make website more accessible.

Added following semantic tags in index.html.
