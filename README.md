Made website(Internet Marketing And Business Management) more readable for Screen Readers
and Search Engine Optimization by adding appropriate Semantic HTML elements in index.html file.
Added following semantic tags in index.html.

- header : Defines a header of a document
- footer : Defines a footer of a document
- nav : Defines a set of navigation links
- main : Defines main content of a document
- section : Defines a section of a document
- article: Defines an independent, self-contained content
- aside : Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
- figure : For images and diagrams
- figcaption: caption(content) for a figure element inside figure element

Did refactor the code in style.css file by combining all classes which has same property values to make css code clean,readable and to avoid duplicate code.
